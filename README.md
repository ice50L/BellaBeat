# Bellabeat Case Study Analysis

# Background/Scenario:
From the founding of Bellabeat in 2013, Bellabeat has grown rapidly and quickly cemented itself as a tech-driven welness company directed at women. 
The company has 5 focus products: bellabeat app, leaf, time, spring and bellabeat membership. Though Bellabeat is a sucessful small business at the moment,
they plan to branch out and/or become a bigger player in the smart device market. Our job is to analyze the data collected from members that use Bellabeat
products in order to gain insight on how the customers are using the products. From this knowledge, the information can be shared to the stakeholders, thereby
coming up with new methods to answer business related questions and expand the company. 

**Task:** Analyze FitBit data to gain insight on how to make Bellabeat grow as a company as well as guide business decisions by the use of data. 

# Questions:
1. How do customers use Bellabeat products?
2. How active are the product users?
3. What day do most users use the products?

# Data visualization and descriptions:

From the given data, it appears that Tuesday is the day that most users log in the app across the week. The marigin difference between the highest, Tuesday 
and the lowest login day, Monday is not large, however there is a noticeable difference. This information is surprising, in that you would expect that 
there would be more log ins during the weekends rather than the weekdays.

From this visualization, it appears that Monday is the day that there is the most total minutes of usage of the apps. The total minutes from Monday is about
1250. Compared to the other days of the week, it appears that there are not much of a difference between each days, the total number of minutes used per day
is about the same throughout.

From the pie chart, there is overwhelming evidence that the sedementary minutes is the most popular compared to the categories of lightly active, fairly
active, and very active minutes. Sedementary minutes makes up about 81.3% of the total categories, therefore it can be concluded that most users spend more
time sitting rather than being active.

From this scatterplot, it appears that the higher the sedentary minutes elapsed, the less calories are burnt, the same otherwise, the less sedentary 
minutes elapsed, the more calories are burnt.

The scatterplot shows that the more total steps that are taken by the users, the more calories are burnt, as expected. Though there are a few outliers
that are present, they can be ignored. 

# Conclusion:

* Sedentary make up the majority of the user daily active minutes as it is 815 of the total. Users spend about 12 hours on average in sedentary minutes
and about 4 hours in lightly active minutes. 
* Users often use the app for the most time on a Tuesday, therefore Bellabeat can conclude and use that data to further come up with ideas in order
to make Tuesday a priority.
* Lastly, according to the scatterplots presented, it appears that most people that use the app spend their time sitting, so the app can give them 
a notification to stand up and move for 5 minutes, much like the apple watch's feature of reminding you to stand every hour.
